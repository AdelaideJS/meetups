# Talks

We hold monthly meetups on the third Tuesday of the month, where we have talks around JS Frameworks, Node.js, and anything even slightly related. It's a friendly, open place for discussion between developers of all levels of experience.

We usually meet at Marjoan located at Level 2, 14 Grenfell St, (above Harryâ€™s Bar).
